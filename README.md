I acquired proficiency in Haskell by completing the CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013) course. This repository houses my solutions for each assignment. While I prioritize independent problem-solving, I occasionally consult external resources when faced with challenges. Post-completion, I find value in scrutinizing alternative solutions as part of my ongoing learning process.
